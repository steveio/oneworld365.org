<h1>Privacy</h1>



<p><?= $_CONFIG['brand']; ?> is committed to protecting your
privacy. Please take a moment to read this site's
Privacy Policy. References to "we", "us" and "our" in
this Policy are references to <?= $_CONFIG['brand']; ?>. This Policy
describes what happens to the information which you
supply to us, where that information identifies you
individually:- e.g. your name and e-mail address
details. We reserve the right to change the terms of
this Privacy Policy from time to time. 
When you register on the forum, some personal
information (including your name, and email addresses)
is collected by us. You may also be asked for your
personal information at other times on this site - in
connection with activities such as competitions, chat
and polls. </p>

<p>We work in accordance with the regulations laid out in
the 2003 Electronic Communications Directive and the
1998 Data Protections Act. If you do have any such
objections, please contact us via the details provided
below. </p>

<p>When does this Privacy Policy not apply? 
This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection of
data by us and the use of that data by us and those
whom we authorise. It does not cover third party sites
to which we provide links, nor does it cover
advertisers and content partners within our service
who may also collect your personal information. They
may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and
conditions of use. If you choose to place your
personal details on any publicly accessible page (for
example, on a message board), then this data will not
be covered by the Privacy Policy. 
<?= $_CONFIG['brand']; ?> is firmly committed to data security. When
you place orders or access your account information,
we offer use of a secure server. The secure server
software encrypts all information you input before it
is sent to us. We take steps to guard against
unauthorised access to customer data. Although we make
every effort to create a secure environment for your
personal information, we cannot guarantee the safety
of any personal information which you transmit to us
online. </p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of
your personal information please e-mail us.</p>
